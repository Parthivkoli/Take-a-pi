Welcome to the **Pi Visualization Gallery**, where we take a slice of Pi (π) and serve it up in vibrant, interactive displays! This project—built with **p5.js** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**—lets you explore the infinite beauty of Pi through three stunning visualizations:

- 🎨 **Colorful Digit Grid**  
- 🌀 **Circular Spiral**  
- 🚶‍♂️ **Random Walk**

> Why did Pi join the art gallery? Because it wanted to be a little more *irrational*!

## 📌 About the Project

This gallery transforms the first 1000 digits of Pi (expandable up to 5000) into three unique visual experiences:

- **Colorful Digit Grid**  
  Each digit becomes a vibrant, pulsating square—Pi’s version of a digital dance party!
  
- **Circular Spiral**  
  Watch digits guide a glowing spiral with smooth particle fade effects—like Pi orbiting a galaxy of its own.

- **Random Walk**  
  Pi takes a pixelated stroll across the screen, leaving behind a dreamy, fading trail—call it a "pi-eceful" journey.

> Why did Pi fail at stand-up comedy? Because it kept going in circles!
